	<t>TODO</t>
	<t>The federated object storage protocol tries to solve three problems:
		<list style="numbers">
			<t>How to store data in a network and support standart operations on it.</t>
			<t>How to enforce access control on the data, for useres from different hosts, without central authentication.</t>
			<t>How to notify users when data is added, removed or has changed.</t>
		</list>
	</t>
	<t>Additionally we want to keep following constraints:
		<list style="numbers">
			<t>The protocol needs tp be data agnostic and should support structured, unstructured and metadata.</t>
			<t>The protocol must be as simple as possible, it must be easy to implement and programms that use it should be easy to deploy.</t>
		</list>

<section anchor="overview" title="Overview">
	<t>The FOSP protocol is mostly a request/response protocol. 
		A user connects to the server of his or her provider, using a client and then both can exchange messages. 
		Request messages are sent from the client to the server to manipulate or retrieve data. 
		Servers respond by sending a response message.
	</t>
	<t>The information units stored on the server have a well defined structure and we call them objects. 
		They are furthermore organized into trees. 
		Each user is identified uniquely by a name and the domain name of his or her provider, similar to an Email address. 
		For each user there exists a tree of objects, stored on the server(s) of his or her provider.

	<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
		"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
		document are to be interpreted as described in <xref target="refs.rfc2119">RFC 2119</xref>.

<section anchor="requirements" title="Requirements">
	<t>FOSP builds on existing protocols and data formats. 
		The transport protocol for FOSP messages currently is the WebSocket protocol, tough other options may be added in the future. 
		Objects are serialized into the JSON notations. 
		Besides these technical dependencies, FOSP is inspired by WebDAV and XMPP and has similarities to LDAP.

<section anchor="terminology" title="Terminology">
	<t>This document uses a number of terminologies to refer to concepts found in FOSP.
		<list style="hanging">
			<t hangText="provider">An entity that provides storage space on the Internet for the data of users. 
				It is identified by a DNS domain name.
			</t>
			<t hangText="server">A FOSP server stores the data of users of a certain provider. 
				Multiple servers can be deployed to deliver the data of a provider to implement fault tolerance and load balancing.
			</t>
			<t hangText="client">A FOSP client is a program a user uses to communicate with a FOSP server. 
				It facilitates accessing the data of the user that is stored on the server.
			</t>
			<t hangText="message">A message is the basic unit of communication in FOSP. 
				Messages come in three different flavours.
			</t>
			<t hangText="request">A request is a message sent from a client to a server. 
				It is used to retrieve or alter data.
			</t>
			<t hangText="response">A response is a message sent from a server to a client. 
				It is always sent as an answer to a request and contains the status of the request and possibly data.
			</t>
			<t hangText="notification">A notification is a message that is sent by servers when changes happen to an object.
			</t>
