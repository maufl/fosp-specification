<t>In the FOSP network, agents are either clients or servers. Each server belongs to
	one provider that is identified by a domain name. For load balancing purposes,
	more than one server per domain might be used. To keep the examples simple,
	we nevertheless assume that there is one server per provider and use the term
	provider and server interchangeable. A user connects, using a client, to the server
	of their provider. We refer to this server as the home server
	of the user.
</t>
<t>To manipulate or access data, the user sends requests. A request can
	act upon a resource. If the resource is not managed by the server the user is con-
	nected to, the server will relay the request to the responsible server. Hence, FOSP
	servers may open connections to other FOSP servers.
