  <t>In the FOSP network, agents are either clients or servers.
  </t>
  <section anchor="network-topology-client" title="Client">
    <t>A user connects, using a client, to the server of their provider.
    We refer to this server as the home server of the user.
    To manipulate or access data, the user uses the client to send requests.
    </t>
    <t>A client can be any programm that understands the FOSP protocol.
    </t>

  <section anchor="network-topology-server" title="Server">
    <t>A server is a software running on a machine on the internet, that processes requests of clients.
    Each server belongs to one provider that is identified by a domain name.
    For load balancing purposes, more than one server per domain/provider might be used.
    To keep the examples simple, we nevertheless assume that there is one server per provider.
    </t>
    <t>A request can act upon a resource.
    If the resource is not managed by the server the user is connected to, the server will relay the request to the responsible server.
    Hence, FOSP servers may open connections to other FOSP servers.
