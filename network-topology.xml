<t>In the FOSP network, agents are either clients or servers.
	Each server belongs to one provider that is identified by a domain name.
	For load balancing purposes, more than one server per domain might be used.
	To keep the examples simple, we nevertheless assume that there is one server per provider and use the term provider and server interchangeable.
	A user connects, using a client, to the server of their provider.
	We refer to this server as the home server of the user.
</t>
<t>To manipulate or access data, the user sends requests.
	A request can act upon a resource.
	If the resource is not managed by the server the user is connected to, the server will relay the request to the responsible server.
	Hence, FOSP servers may open connections to other FOSP servers.
