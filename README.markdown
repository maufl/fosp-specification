#FOSP Specification

This is the official, work in progress documentation of the Federated Object Sharing Protocol (FOSP).
I repeat, this is a work in progress version. It is neither complete nor well structured nor very precise.
Use with caution.

## Dependencies

To compile the xml files into a txt file or a html file the xml2rfc utility is needed.
Compilation to pdf furthermore requires the imagemagic library (or more specifically the convert binary), groff, pstops (psutils) and ghostscript (the ps2pdf binary).

## Compilation

Run make. Look at the make file to see which targets are supported.
