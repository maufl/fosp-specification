  <t>Bindings define how a FOSP message is transported via an existing protocol.
  Currently a binding for the WebSocket protocol is defined and a binding for HTTP is being worked on.
  </t>
  <section anchor="bindings-ws" title="WebSocket binding">
    <t>The WebSocket binding provides a way of sending FOSP messages of WebSocket messages.
    It was chosen because it is  the only bidirectional protocol currently supported in browsers.
    </t>
    <section anchor="bindings-ws-connection-initiation" title="Connection Initiation">
      <t>To send messages to a server over WebSockets, a connection has to be established first.
      How the server address, port and URL path are determined for a given domain is discussed in&nbsp;<xref target="discovery" />.
      In the WebSocket handshake, the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol MUST be set to "fosp".
      </t>

    <section anchor="msg-format" title="Format">
      <t>The FOSP messages is formatted similar to a HTTP request/response.
      </t>
      <t><em>WARNING: To simplify the definition for the moment, only ASCII characters are used.
      This WILL change as the protocol itself mandates the use of Unicode and the UTF-8 encoding and international user and resource names MUST be supported</em>
      Also the header definition will be subject to change after determining acceptable characters.
      For the resource identifier, we will probably refer to the IRI definition in the future.

    <section anchor="msg-serialization" title="Serialization">
      <t>Messages are serialized into a blob of bytes and sent inside a single WebSocket message.
      Most of the message is text in UTF-8 encoding, only the body is either a valid JSON object, UTF-8 encoded, or raw bytes.
      The second case occurs when an attachment is up- or downloaded.
      The beginning and end, e.g. the length of a message must be determined from lenght of the WebSocket message.
      </t>
      <t>When a message contains binary data that is not UTF-8 encoded text, e.g. a WRITE request, a binary WebSocket message MUST be used.
      Otherwise, when the whole message is valid UTF-8 encoded text, a text WebSocket message CAN be used.
      </t>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section anchor="bindings-http" title="HTTP binding">
    <t>The HTTP binding is developed because it might be simpler for clients to process large up- or downloads via HTTP.
    However, it does not support all of FOSPs functionality because notifications can not be sent over HTTP (at least over HTTP/1.1).
    </t>
    <section anchor="bingings-http-mapping" title="Mapping">
      <t>Each FOSP request is transported as an HTTP request.
      The request identifier is used as the HTTP method.
      The HTTP request-URI MUST be the absolute URI of the FOSP object.
      The HTTP headers are the FOSP headers.
      The HTTP body is the FOSP body.
      </t>
    </section>
    <section anchor="bindings-http-session-management" title="Session management">
      <t>To support authenticated requests, a FOSP server that supports the HTTP binding MUST return a cookie in a success response to a BIND request.
      With this cookie, the client is able to make authenticated requests.
