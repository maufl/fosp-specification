  <t>First, the agent that wants to open a new connection has to find out which server
  to connect to and on which port. The server responsible for a certain domain is the
  server with the IP address that is assigned to the DNS A record of the domain name 
  and the port is 1337 for insecure connections and 1338 for secure connections (e.g. ws:// or wss://).
  In the future, a better approach of discovering the
  server will be necessary and probably done by using DNS SRV records.
  </t>
  <t>After opening a connection to a server, the initiator first sends a CONNECT
  request that has to be answered with a SUCCEEDED response if the connection
  is accepted. The body of the request contains information about the supported
  version of the protocol and could in the future be used to negotiate more pa-
  rameters of the connection. The response, if successful, contains the version the
  server supports and could also be used to advertise additional services provided
  by the server.
  </t>
  <t>If the connection is opened by a client to a server, a new user can then be
  registered with the REGISTER request. Finally, the initiator has to authenticate
  to the server he connects to. The specific mechanism of authentication depends
  on whether a client connects to a server or a server connects to another server.
