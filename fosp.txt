                 The Federated Object Sharing Protocol
                                fosp-00

Abstract

   This document describes the Federated Object Sharing Protocol (FOSP).
   FOSP is a protocol that allows sharing arbitrary data, setting access
   rights on the shared data and receiving notifications on changes.
   Furthermore, all features of FOSP can be used in a federated network,
   e.g. between multiple independned providers.  It was designed to be
   the most simple solution that combines all these features.

Internet-Draft                    FOSP                    September 2014


1.  Introduction

1.1.  Purpose

   The Federated Object Storage Protocol (FOSP) is an application-level
   protocol for exchanging structured and unstructured data generated by
   users of different providers.  It is designed to fulfill the needs of
   online social networks by combining necessary features into one
   simple protocol.

   FOSP aims to provide three core features:

   1.  Store data online and support standard operations on it.

   2.  Enforce access control on the data, for users from different
       hosts, without central authentication.

   3.  Notify users when data is added, removed or has changed.

   Furthermore, some non-functional requirements are imposed.  The
   protocol needs to be data agnostic and should support structured,
   unstructured and metadata.  It also must be as simple as possible,
   e.g. it must be easy to implement and it should be possible to write
   easy to deploy applications for it.

1.2.  Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119
   [refs.rfc2119].

1.3.  Requirements

   FOSP builds on existing protocols and data formats.  The transport
   protocol for FOSP messages currently is the WebSocket protocol and a
   HTTP binding is in the works.  Other options may be added in the
   future.  Objects are serialized into the JavaScript Object Notation
   (JSON).  Besides these technical dependencies, FOSP is inspired by
   WebDAV and XMPP and has similarities to LDAP.

1.4.  Terminology

   This document uses a number of terminologies to refer to concepts
   found in FOSP.

   provider  An entity that provides storage space on the Internet for
      the data of users.  It is identified by a fully qualified domain
      name.

   server  A FOSP server stores the data of users of a certain provider.
      The term server applies to the the software that processes request
      as well as to the machine that runs the software.  For fault
      tolerance and load balancing purposes, a provider might deploy
      multiple servers.

   client  A FOSP client is a program a user uses to communicate with a
      FOSP server.  It facilitates accessing the data of the user that
      is stored on the server.

   message  A message is the basic unit of communication in FOSP.
      Messages come in three different flavours.

   request  A request is a message sent from a client to a server.  It
      is used to retrieve or alter data.

   response  A response is a message sent from a server to a client.  It
      is always sent as an answer to a request and contains the status
      of the request and possibly data.

   notification  A notification is a message that is sent by servers
      when changes happen to an object.

   object  An object is the basic unit of data in FOSP.  It consists of
      structured data expressed in JSON.

   attachment  An attachment is a binary or text file that is associated
      with an object.  Each object can only have one attachment.

   tree  The objects of a users form a tree structure.  Each object has
      exactly one parent object, except for the root object.

2.  Overview

2.1.  User and providers

   In the FOSP world, data is created by users.  Users store their
   content on the servers of providers and can share it by setting the
   appropriate access rights for other users.  Each user is registered
   with one provider.  The user has an unique name at the provider that
   together with the domain name of the provider forms his or her
   identifier, similar to an Email address.  However users can still
   share their content with friends that are registered with different
   providers.

   Providers are companies or individuals that provide storage for
   users.  A provider is identified by a fully qualified domain name.
   Similar to Email and XMPP, everybody can be a provider by simply
   hosting his or her own FOSP server.  The servers of different
   providers communicate to allow users of different providers to share
   data.

2.2.  Trees, Objects and Attachments

   The basic data units that can be stored on the server have a well
   defined structure and we call them objects.  We chose this name
   because they are objects in the sense of the JSON specification.
   Other familiar terms for a JSON object might be dictionary, hashmap
   of associative array.  They consist of key-value pairs where each key
   is a string and each value is one of the values allowed by JSON.
   Most of the key-value pairs have a special meaning, for example there
   is a key-value pair that stores the access conrol list.

   All objects are part of a tree.  For each user, one such tree exists
   and the root object of the tree is named like the user.  Each object
   can thus be uniquely identified by its path, e.g.
   alice@wonderlant.lit/social/me.

   To store data that can not be expressed in JSON, each object can have
   an attachment.  The attachement is addressed in the same way as the
   object but is modified using special requests.

2.3.  Network topology

   FOSP follows the client-server paradigm.  The network topology is
   similar to the SMTP or XMPP network.  A provider operates one or more
   server that handle the domain of the provider.  A user can use a
   client to connect to a server of a provide where he or she is
   registered and request data.

   The server can connect to a server of a different provider to forward
   request it can not process itself.  This is the case when the request
   concerns an object that is not stored by this server because it
   belongs to a user of a different provider.

2.4.  Messages

   The communication between FOSP clients and servers is segmented into
   messages.  There a three different kind of messages: requests,
   responses and notifications.

   To create, alter or delete objects and attachments, a client sends a
   request to the server.  When the request is processed, the server
   sends a response.  If the request concerns an object that the server
   does not store, it may be forwarded to a server that does store it.

   As users and clients might be interested in changes to objects and
   attachments, they can subscribe to events on objects.  When a server
   makes changes to objects or attachments, it can send notifications to
   clients that inform about events that happened.

2.5.  Bindings

   The messages are transported using existing transport protocols.  A
   definition of how FOSP messages are transported through an existing
   protocol is called binding.

   The currently defined binding is the WebSocket binding.  An HTTP
   binding, which will not support all FOSP features, is also worked on.

3.  Data structure

3.1.  Objects

   We refer to the basic unit of data, that can be manipulated in the
   FOSP network, as an object.  An object consists of key-value pairs.
   The constraints for keys and values are the ones described by the
   JSON specification.  Each object has by default specific key value
   pairs that have a special meaning, for example, the key "owner"
   contains the identifier of the user who created the object.  When
   transferring objects in messages, the object is serialized according
   to the JSON specification.  In the rest of the document we will refer
   to a key-value pair of an object either as an attribute or a field of
   an object.

3.2.  Object attributes

   Most attributes of an object have a well defined meaning.  The
   servers have to ensure that the content of these attributes adheres
   to the specification and that users do not make changes that are not
   allowed.  Figure 1 shows an example of an objects with all the fields
   described here.  Currently we define the following attributes and
   their values:

      The "owner" field is set by the server on creation of the object
      and contains the identifier of the user who created the object as
      a string.  It determines the ownership of this object and is used
      when enforcing access rights.  The user MUST NOT be able to set
      the field to a different value.

Internet-Draft                    FOSP                    September 2014


      The "btime" (birth time) field is set by the server to the date of
      creation of the object.  It is saved as a string, formatted
      according to the ISO 8601 standard and must always be in the UTC
      time zone.  The user MUST NOT be able to set the field to a
      different value.

      Similar the "mtime" (modify time) is set to the current date each
      time the object is altered and is not to be set by the users
      directly.  It is saved just like "btime".  In the future it might
      be used to allow client side caching similar to ETags in HTTP.
      The user MUST NOT be able to set the field to a different value.

      The "data" field is where the user should save the payload and may
      contain any valid value.  The "type" field should contain a string
      that describes the content type of the "data" field, similar to
      MIME types.  These two fields are the only fields where the user
      can save arbitrary data.  The server MUST allow the user to store
      any data in this fields.

   Furthermore, there are the three fields "acl", "subscriptions" and
   "attachment" that contain more complex objects.

   The "acl" field saves information about access rights in form of an
   object.  It is read by the server to enforce access control.

      The acl object can have the following fields: "owner", "users",
      "groups", "other"

      The value of the "owner" and "other" field is a set of rights

      A set of rights is an object where each key identifies a certain
      scope the right applies to, and the value is a string array of
      permissions.  For example, the key "acl" means that the
      permissions apply to the acl field of the object.  Currently
      allowed values for the key are "acl", "data", "subscriptions",
      "children".  The permissions can be "read", "write" and "delete".
      They can also be prefixed with "not-" to revoke a right, which is
      necessary because rights are inherited.  This will be further
      explained in Section 6.1.

      The value of the "users" and "groups" field is an object.  In
      these objects, each key identifies a user or a group and the
      related value is a set of rights.

   The "subscriptions" field stores information about subscriptions.  It
   is read by the server to determine which users have to be notified on
   changes to an object.

      It contains an object and each key is the identifier of a user.

      The value is an object with the fields: "events" and "depth"

      The value of "events" is an array of strings which identify an
      event, the value of "depth" is an integer between -1 and infinity

   How this field is evaluated by the server is explained
   in Section 6.2.

   The "attachment" field is only present if this object has an
   attachment.  It contains an object with three fields.

      The "name" field contains a string with the file name.

      The "size" field contains the number of bytes of the attached
      file.  The value of this field MUST be set by the server whenever
      a WRITE request changes the size of the file.  The value of this
      field MUST NOT be set by a user.

      The "type" field contains a string with the mime-type of the
      attached file.

3.3.  Trees

   In FOSP, all objects are part of a tree of objects.  Therefore, all
   objects have a parent object, except for the root object of a tree.
   Consequently, all objects can have child objects.  For each user
   there exists one tree of objects and the root node of this tree is
   named like the identifier of the user.  The tree of the user is
   stored on the servers that are responsible for the domain of the
   provider where the user is registered.

3.4.  Attachments

   As files, like pictures and documents, are also shared via social
   networks, FOSP supports saving binary files.  For each object, one
   file can be saved as an attachment.  This way, files can be addressed
   with the same schema and the objects they are attached to can provide
   the meta-data.  If an object has a belonging file, it is extended by
   a new attribute named "attachment".  In this attribute, the "size",
   file "name", and MIME "type" of the file is saved.  The attached file
   is read and written using special requests.

3.5.  Provisioned Objects

   Some objects in the tree of a user will be used by the server to
   obtain configuration options.  For example
   alice@wonderland.lit/config/groups will contain the mappings from
   users to groups that are valid for the tree alice@wonderland.lit.
   These objects will be created by the server when the user first
   registers with it.

4.  Network Topology

   In the FOSP network, agents are either clients or servers.

4.1.  Client

   A user connects, using a client, to the server of their provider.  We
   refer to this server as the home server of the user.  To manipulate
   or access data, the user uses the client to send requests.

   A client can be any programm that understands the FOSP protocol.

4.2.  Server

   A server is a software running on a machine on the internet, that
   processes requests of clients.  Each server belongs to one provider
   that is identified by a domain name.  For load balancing purposes,
   more than one server per domain/provider might be used.  To keep the
   examples simple, we nevertheless assume that there is one server per
   provider.

   A request can act upon a resource.  If the resource is not managed by
   the server the user is connected to, the server will relay the
   request to the responsible server.  Hence, FOSP servers may open
   connections to other FOSP servers.

5.  Messages

   Messages are the basic unit of communication in the FOSP network.
   There are three different types of messages which serve different
   purposes.  How a message is serialized depends on the protocol that
   is used to transport the message.

5.1.  Types

   Each message has a specific type, which determines the kind of
   purpose this message serves.  The type is implicitly given in the way
   that the content of the message determines it's type.  For now there
   are only three types of messages needed to support all functionality.
   The types are requests, responses and notifications.  Should there be
   the need for additional types of messages, a new one can be added in
   later versions of the protocol.

   All messages can have headers and a body, similar to HTTP messages
   and are distinguished by their main attributes.  Requests and
   notifications usually act on, or are emitted from an object or an
   attachemnt.  The identifier of the object or attachemnt is then part
   of the request.  If a request does not act upon an object, the
   identifier is replaced with an asterisk.

5.2.  Request

   Requests are sent from clients to servers to authenticate or
   manipulate objects.  A request consists of ...

      a request type

      optionally an identifier of a resource that it manipulates

   The content of the body depends on the type of request.  For example,
   the body of a GET or DELETE request is empty and the body of a CREATE
   request contains the new object.  In general the body is a JSON
   object, except for the WRITE request that has the byte representation
   of the file as the body.

   The server MUST always responde to a request with a response message.
   Depending on the request, the server must check access rights and
   whether a certain object exits, bevor the request can be processed.
   If the user does not have sufficent rights or an required object does
   not exist (e.g. a parent object when creating a child), a failure
   response MUST be sent.  When the request is successfully processed, a
   success response MUST be sent.  Depending on the request, it may
   contain information in its body, like the object that was requested,
   or an attachment that was read.

Internet-Draft                    FOSP                    September 2014


   The request types are described in the following sections.

5.2.1.  Info

   TODO

5.2.2.  Bind

   The BIND request is used to authenticate the client.  The body MUST
   contain an object with the "method" attribute that specifies the used
   authentication method.  The possible methods of authentication are
   not final yet, however every server SHOULD support a simple
   authentication by name and password.  In this case the object also
   contains a "user" and "password" attribute containing the full user
   name and the password.

   The server verifies that the authentication is successfull and sents
   a success response or a failed response otherwise.  All future
   request are made in the name of this authenticated user.  How the
   state is kept depends on the transport protocol used.  It can for
   example either be a tied to network connection, or be a cookie
   supplied in each request.

5.2.3.  Get

   The GET request is used to retrieve an object.  The resource
   identifier in the request denotes the object that should be returned.
   The server MUST ignore any content in the body of the request.

   If the request was successfull, the object is returned in the body of
   the response..  Even on success, not the whole object might be
   returned as the user might have the right to read some attributes but
   not others.

5.2.4.  List

   The LIST request is used to discover all child objects of a certain
   object.  The resource identifier specifies the object of which the
   children should be returned.

   If successfull, the response contains an array of names of the child
   objects.

5.2.5.  Create

   The CREATE request is used to store new objects on the server.  The
   resource identifier is the desired location for the new object.  The
   body containes the object to store.

Internet-Draft                    FOSP                    September 2014


   On success, an empty success response is returned and the object is
   stored at the given location.

5.2.6.  Patch

   The PATCH request is used to update an already existing object on the
   server.  The resource identifier specifies the object that should be
   updated.  The body containes an object with the differences that
   should be applied to the object.

   The differences are merged into the object as follows.  If the
   original object does not have an attribute the differences object
   has, the attribute is copied to the object.  If the original object
   already has an attribute the differences object has and the new value
   is , the attribute is deleted from the object.  If the original
   object already has an attribute the differences object has and the
   value is not null, the attribute is replaced with the new attribute
   except when the value of the old and the new attribute are both an
   object.  In this case the merging is done on the attribute recursivly
   as it is on the whole object.

   On success, an empty success response is returned.

5.2.7.  Delete

   The DELETE request is used to remove an object from a tree.  The
   resource identifier specifies the object that should be removed.

   If successfull, a succeeded message is returned and the object is
   permanently removed.

5.2.8.  Read

   The READ request is used to read the attachment.  The resource
   identifier specifies the object of which the attachment should be
   read.

   The success response body contains the raw bytes of the attachment.

5.2.9.  Write

   The WRITE request is used to write to the attachment.  The resource
   identifier specifies the object of which the attachment should be
   written.  The body contains the raw bytes of the attachment.

   The success response is empty.

5.3.  Response

   Responses are sent from servers to clients when a request has been
   processed.  A response has ...

      a type, either "SUCCEEDED" or "FAILED".

      a status code, an integer greater zero.

   The body of a response depends on the request that is answered.  For
   a CREATE or DELETE request it would be empty, for a GET request it
   would be the object that was requested.  In case of a READ request it
   would contain the raw bytes of the attachment.

   The status code is explained in Section 5.5.

5.4.  Notification

   Notifications are sent from servers to clients when objects change
   and the client has subscribed to those changes.  A notification
   consists of ...

      an event which is one of "CREATED", "UPDATED" or "DELETED".

      a resource identifier.

   The notifications are sent when a request triggers an event, for
   example CREATE triggers a CREATED event.  If the event equals DELETED
   then the body of the notification must be empty.  Otherwise it should
   contain the new version of the object.

   When and to who notifications are sent is explained in Section 6.2.

5.5.  Status codes

   TODO

5.6.  Format

   **WARNING: To simplify the definition for the moment, only ASCII
   characters are used.  This WILL change as the protocol itself
   mandates the use of Unicode and the UTF-8 encoding and international
   user and resource names MUST be supported**

   Also the header definition will be subject to change after
   determining acceptable characters.  For the resource identifier, we
   will probably refer to the IRI definition in the future.

5.7.  Serialization

   Messages are serialized into a blob of bytes.  Most of the message is
   text in UTF-8 encoding, only the body is either a valid JSON object,
   UTF-8 encoded, or not interpreted at all.  The second case occurs
   when an attached file is up- or downloaded.  The beginning and end,
   e. g. the length of a message must be determined from lenght of the
   WebSocket message.

6.  Policies

   Besides implementing the technical specification of the protocol, the
   server has to enforce a set of policies.  These policies describe how
   the server interprets the objects to enforces access control and send
   notifications for subscriptions.  They also define constraints on
   certain attributes of objects and constraints on whether or not a
   message should be forwarded.

6.1.  Access control

   As stated in Section 3.2, each object can save access control
   information.  A valid entry in the access control list consists of
   the identifier of a user or a group of users and a list of rights.
   Manipulation of different parts of the object can require different
   rights, for example, altering access control information requires the
   "acl-write" right.  Because the objects are part of a tree, we can
   use inheritance to set access rights for a whole subtree by setting
   the appropriate access control information on the root of the
   subtree.  This way the rights on an object are the sum of the rights
   on this object and all it's ancestors.  To still be able to have less
   rights on a child object, rights can be prefix with "not-" to
   explicitly remove a right, for example "not-acl-write".  The server
   must enforce access control for an object in the following way.

   1.  Check if the right in question is set on the current object

   2.  If it is set positive (e.g. not prefixed with "not-") grant
       access

   3.  If it is set negative (e.g. prefixed with "not-") deny access

   4.  If is is not set, go to the parent object and repeat from step 1.

   5.  If the current object is already the root object, deny access

6.2.  Subscriptions

   Similar to the access control information, subscriptions can be set
   on objects so that a user will be notified when changes occur.  A
   subscription consists of an identifier of a user, a list of events to
   subscribe to and a "depth".  The depth is used to subscribe to events
   from all child objects to a certain depth.  When a change happens on
   an object, the server must use the following algorithm to determine
   which users must be notified.

   1.  Read the "subscriptions" from the current object.

Internet-Draft                    FOSP                    September 2014


   2.  For each subscription: If the event that occurred is in the list
       of subscribed events and the distance of the current object to
       the object where the event occurred is smaller or equal to the
       "depth" of the subscription or the "depth" is equal to "-1", add
       the user of this subscription to the list of users that should be
       notified.  The distance between two objects is 0 if they are the
       same object, 1 if one is the parent of the other and so on.

   3.  Go to the parent of the current object and repeat from step 1.
       unless the current object is the root object

   An important aspect to consider when sending notifications that
   include the new version of the object, is that every user who will be
   notified might be allowed to only see different parts of the object.
   Therefore, the server has to calculate the view of the object per
   user to prevent leaking of data a user might not be allowed to see.

6.3.  Attachments

   As explained in Section 3.4, each object can have a file as
   attachment.  However, attachments will likely not be stored together
   with objects, but in a storage that is more suitable for files.
   Depending on how the server implements operations on attachments, it
   is possible that there exists an attachment for an object in the
   storage but the object itself is missing the "attachment" field.  In
   any case the behavior of the server should be consistent.  Hence, if
   there is no attachment field in the object then the attachment should
   be deleted and an attachment should only be readable if there is an
   attachment field in the object.

6.4.  Authentication and Registration

   When a client connects to a server, it has to provide credentials to
   the server, so that the user of the client can be authenticated.
   These are send in the body of the AUTHENTICATE request and can simply
   be an object containing the name and the password of the user.  The
   schema of authentication is not limited thought as the body can
   contain arbitrary structured data.  Server to server authentication
   is done using the DNS.  When a server receives a connection from
   another server it verifies that the domain of the connecting server
   resolves to the same IP address the connection comes from.

   The REGISTER request should be supported by all servers, but can be
   disabled to prevent automatic creation of accounts by autonomous
   programs.  It is also not required that the REGISTER command is the
   only way to create an acount on a server.  For example, there could
   be sign up forms on websites or a server of a company could be
   connected to a directory service and fetch the login informations

   from there.

6.5.  Message forwarding

   A server does not need to accept forwarded requests from other
   servers, if it shouldn't be part of the federated network.  This
   allows FOSP to be used in cooperate environments or other closed
   environments where federation with the outside world is not allowed.

   In any case, a server must never accept a forwarded request if the
   user of the request is not on the domain of the server that forwarded
   the request.  For example, if server A, that is authoritative for
   domain "example. net", authenticates to server B and then forwards a
   request of user "alice@wonderland. lit", server B must close the
   connection.

7.  Connection Initiation

   First, the agent that wants to open a new connection has to find out
   which server to connect to and on which port.  The server responsible
   for a certain domain is the server with the IP address that is
   assigned to the DNS A record of the domain name and the port is 1337
   for insecure connections and 1338 for secure connections (e.g. ws://
   or wss://).  In the future, a better approach of discovering the
   server will be necessary and probably done by using DNS SRV records.

   After opening a connection to a server, the initiator first sends a
   CONNECT request that has to be answered with a SUCCEEDED response if
   the connection is accepted.  The body of the request contains
   information about the supported version of the protocol and could in
   the future be used to negotiate more pa- rameters of the connection.
   The response, if successful, contains the version the server supports
   and could also be used to advertise additional services provided by
   the server.

   If the connection is opened by a client to a server, a new user can
   then be registered with the REGISTER request.  Finally, the initiator
   has to authenticate to the server he connects to.  The specific
   mechanism of authentication depends on whether a client connects to a
   server or a server connects to another server.
